                      <p>Tim is a common kid with a special dream: He wants to save the world!
                        But how can he do that when he's only a little child?
                        
                        Here is where his creativity comes in help. ðŸ™‚
                        Every night when he goes to sleep, he enters a virtual world into his dreams
                        and fights the evildoers. He's a simple human during the day and a hero at night.
                        He becomes whatever hero he wants to become and fights with his enemies.
                        
                        Will you join him in his night by night adventures? He might need a comrade.*wink*</p>
